## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added Grok subscription usage tracking with browser OAuth, explicit Grok CLI
  credential import/restore, managed accounts, and host Active matching.
- Added Z.AI Coding Plan usage tracking with managed API keys, five-hour, weekly,
  and optional MCP windows, plus content-aware OpenCode key detection and prefill.
- Added Moonshot/Kimi Platform API fallback for Kimi accounts. When the Kimi
  Coding endpoint returns no usable usage data, YapCap queries
  `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1/users/me/balance` and displays the available
  balance as a **Credits** usage window (normalized to 100 units) and as
  available credits.

### Fixed

- Fixed invisible back-button text in the Kimi popup under light COSMIC themes
  by replacing the hardcoded white color with the theme's component foreground
  color.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added Google Antigravity usage tracking with Google OAuth accounts, grouped
  Gemini and Claude/GPT quota windows, reauthentication, and multi-account
  support.
- Added Kimi for Coding usage tracking with API-key managed accounts, weekly and
  rate-limit windows, account reauthentication, and multi-account support.
- Re-added OpenCode Go usage tracking with API-key managed accounts and 5-hour,
  weekly, and monthly windows.
- Re-added optional one-time OpenCode `auth.json` credential discovery: compatible
  keys prefill Minimax, Kimi, and OpenCode Go forms, while Codex and GitHub
  Copilot offer explicit OAuth imports. OpenCode is not used as a live refresh
  or synchronization source.
- Added automatic provider detection with live re-detection, tri-state provider
  enablement, and first-run empty states that guide users to account setup.
- Added adaptive provider navigation, dedicated provider management, and
  detected-provider setup actions.

### Changed

- Improved provider usage meters, account matching, popup navigation, and usage
  amount handling across provider tabs.
- Redesigned provider account management with shared authentication and account
  lifecycle behavior across providers.

### Fixed

- Improved API-key account validation, popup sizing and transparency, account
  actions, and reauthentication badge wrapping.
